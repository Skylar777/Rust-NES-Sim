# vgm-audio-processor (IN_PROGRESS)

## Description
Retro chiptune music is starting to make a resurgence with the popularity of many retro indie games like Hades and Celeste. However, a majority of music produced for these games rarely use actual hardware that made the 8-bit and 16-bit music charming. The purpose of this project is to replicate a sound chip from the NES/SNES using a programming language.
